# wordBlitz
Cheat for word blitz greek (only for windows)

To run the code if you dont have g++ installed I found it fast downloading dev cpp
https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/

and running bot.cpp, you also have to compile with -std=c++11

From there just follow the instructions on the console
